## 🎓 College & Career Selection Project  
**Review: Arrays of Objects (HTML • CSS • JavaScript)**

---

### 📖 Assignment Description

In this project, you will build a webpage that displays your **top 5 college, trade school, or career choices**, ranked in order of importance:

- **1 = Most important**
- **5 = Least important**

If attending college is not part of your plan, you may instead choose:
- Companies you want to work for
- Trades or career paths you are interested in
- Locations you wish to travel to eventually

You will use **JavaScript objects and an array of objects** to store and display this information dynamically on the page.

---

### 👀 Preview

Your finished page should visually display **five cards or sections**, each showing information about one college, trade school, or company.

---

## 🛠️ Instructions

### 1️⃣ Create the Data

- Each object represents **one college, trade school, or company**
- Use the provided object structure to store the data

Example properties may include:
- Name  
- Location  
- Program or position  
- Website  
- Logo or image  
- Rank (1–5)

---

### 2️⃣ Display the Data

- Use JavaScript to **insert object data into the HTML template**
- All content must be displayed dynamically using JavaScript
- Do **not** hardcode content directly in HTML

---

### 3️⃣ Styling & Layout

- Use the provided HTML/CSS template **or create your own**
- Ensure your layout is:
  - Clean  
  - Readable  
  - Responsive
